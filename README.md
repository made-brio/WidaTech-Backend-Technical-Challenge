# WidaTech Backend Technical Challenge
 This repository contains the solution for WidaTech's Backend Engineer Technical Challenge, focusing on software integration for IoT applications. The challenge is divided into three sections:  Invoice CRUD API: Developed RESTful APIs to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for invoice management using MySQL/PostgreSQL. Features include:  Data validation (type, length, required fields). Read API returns paginated invoices with total profit and cash transaction summaries. CSV/XLSX Import and Parsing: API to import and parse XLSX files containing invoices and product data:  Validates data integrity and structure. Returns errors for invalid invoices while saving valid entries. Handles duplicate invoice detection and reference checks for product data. Problem-Solving Algorithm: Efficient function to generate unique, non-repeating digit combinations (1-9) based on given length and sum constraints.  Tech Stack: Golang, MySQL/PostgreSQL, REST API.
